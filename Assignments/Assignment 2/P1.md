1. The five additional tasks that we have chosen are:

**Advanced Searching For Content**

The movie organizer is going to have a very large list of content, so it's important to be able to narrow down what search fields are criteria are important for a user. We plan to have a simple, organized search, which is also dynamic and understands that tags and attributes that users have chosen in their library. Using simple list, segment, and text controls, we plan to allow users to search their movie database.

**Tagging and Organizing Items Arbitrarily**

In studying our users, we learned that not every user organizes their movies the same way. Some have a simple watchlist, others have various watchlists (such as to watch with their girlfriend, by themselves, etc), etc. To solve this issue and keep our movie organizer fluid, we opted to have arbitrary tagging instead of predefined categories. When the user launches the app, we'll prefill their tags with watchlist, buylist, faves, etc. From here, users can arbitrarily add new tags to their movies as they'd like, or add movies to existing tags. This allows our users to have full control over how they organize their content, while still making the software intuitive by prefilling tags, so they understand how the taggin system works.

**Collaborating on Ratings, Reviews, and Information**

When viewing each movie, we plan to fill data from the Internet and other users to allow for ratings and reviews. When using the movie organizer, users will be able to vote reviews as helpful, add their own reviews, rate movies, and more. We also plan to have social media integration so users can see movies that their friends like (this will also be a part of our advanced search). We also want to have movie trailers and other videos here, so our users can get an idea of the movies they're interacting with, if they haven't seen them before.

**Consuming Content**

Viewing movie information is great, but we want to actually allow users to watch their films! To do this, we plan to add information about theatre times, rental locations, iTunes availability, Netflix availability, and more. When a user has a movie in the organizer, they should be able to easily find out how to play the movie.

**Viewing Content in the Movie Organizer**

We want to make it really simple to view movies in the movie organizer. Scatterplots and lists aren't intuitive and don't provide a lot of information. Using rich visuals, well placed text, and more, we can have lists for the power user which are still visual appealing and easy to understand. For the more casual viewer, we plan to have a cover-flow style system which allows users to effortlessly scroll through movies one by one. The latter makes it super simple to pick movies to watch from their organizer, while the former makes editing great too.
